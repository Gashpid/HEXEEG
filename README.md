# HEXEEG
A prototype of BCI medical equipment was designed based on Neurofeedback techniques,
with which a test subject was trained to self-regulate his brain waves, thus improving his
attentional processes and concentration, through the identification of concentration and
attention indexes extracted thanks to the Theta/Beta Ratio (TBR) and Sustained attention
(SA) protocols.
The prototype has two user interfaces, one of which is directed to the health professional
and the other is a simple video game directed to the test subject. This prototype extracts the
characteristics related to the test subject's concentration and attention and evaluates them by
means of a machine learning (ML) algorithm, with which 97% effectiveness was obtained
in offline tests (with database) and 97.5% effectiveness with online tests (with real-time
data).
Dry active electrodes of gain 2 were designed, with electromagnetic noise elimination. An
acquisition card with 16 physical channels and 3 multiplexed channels for a total of 19
channels was also designed; it has an ARM-Cortex M7 MCU which controls two ADS1299
signal conditioners and performs the preprocessing. Both the active electrodes and the
designed acquisition card are powered by a power supply card with a 5V unipolar output
and a Â±2.5V bipolar output; it is powered by two 850mA LI-ion batteries, which provides
autonomy of about eight hours.
